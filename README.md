Bioinformatics_Intro
====================

This repository is dedicated to the development of an introductory bioinformatics course. The target audience of the course is advanced undergraduates and first year graduate students in the biological science who have had limited experience writing code or using command line applications. 

Most of the information for the course will be stored on the course wiki pages. Code used in the course will be included as part of the repository.
